# 100 Days Of Python

This project is comes from Dr. Angela Yu's Udemy course 100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp for 2022.

This repo will encompass my journey of learning as much as I can about python and it's best practices.

Inside each folder is a project to practice working with python. The projects start out easier covering basic programming concepts and slowly become more difficult tackling more complex intricacies.

## To download needed dependencies:

If there is a Pipfile inside a folder, navigate to that folder and run `pipenv install` to download the needed dependencies.

## To run a file:

Simply navigate to the desired folder and run `python3 main.py`.

NOTE: Some of these projects will not be the best solution to the problem, this is simply a learning journey for me.
