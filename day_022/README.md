# Classic Pong Game

This is the classic pong game that has two paddles that move and hit a ball back and forth

## Modules:

This project uses the built in turtle module to be able to create a display as well as the paddles and ball.

## Differences from Course:

- I doubled the sizes of everything since I am using a large screen
- Instead of changing the balls x and y coordinates, I decided to change the angle it's directioned and just have it move forward.

## Things to add:

- A way to choose between a small and large screen
